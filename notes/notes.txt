I used the following seriese of commands to count all .jpg files existing in this directory tree:


$ tree | grep '.jpg' | wc -l

111,949 character images
5,499   html files

1.html - 5498.html:  18 chars for per file:  98,964 chars in this block
5,499.html:           6 chars in last file:  6 chars in this block

a total of 98,970 chars in all fetched html files.
if we assume that each character points to a distinct character jpg, -> Have not checked this assumption

then we have 12,979 unassociated characters:  These characters are likely untranslated, as the Meaning is null for at least some of them
